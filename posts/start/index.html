With that in mind, I wanted to choose a complex topic where I could make something cool while learning another area of computer science.\nProject timeline The following list is my current timeline. I have estimated that each step should take approximately 2 weeks for me to complete (hopefully).\n Creating a UEFI Application. (This post) Loading the IDT and GDT. Interrups and PS2 keyboard and mouse. PCI bus and basic USB. Memory and a basic memory allocator. File System. Multitasking async/await. Basic terminal. Basic networking stack. Cool things I think of as I go…  Making a builder application The first step in creating the UEFI application was creating a builder. This builder would need to run cargo build on the kernel/bootloader and then bundle them with the assets into a fat32 img.\nThe first hurdle was building the kernel and bootloader. I initally planed on using cargo workspaces to build everything, however due to this cargo issue i could not do that. Instead I recursively ran cargo build in each directory using rust’s subprocess capablitites.\nTo create the fat32 img I employed the crate fat32 which exposed a virtual filesystem object. This enabled me to simple open the files from my disk and use std::io::copy to copy the file into the img.\nThe final version was called using cargo run in the project root. The builder also launches qemu after a successful build.\nMaking a bootloader and loading the kernel For the bootloader I used the crate uefi to provide the UEFI types. I was also following Poncho’s C tutorial as the base for my OS.\nI initially had some issues with the uefi crate becuase I hadn’t encounted rust type parameters used to determine the action a function should do. However once I worked out how to use the create I was able to successfully create a working bootloader.\nTo load the kernel into RAM I used the crate xmas_elf to read the elf data into useful structs. When requesting memory from the UEFI I got a bunch of errors as shown below.\nDespite this the kernel loads successfully and returns the product of 5 and 3. As such I will procede and maybe fix this if it starts breaking my kernel.\nLoading GOP and making the println! macro As I knew how to use the UEFI crate grabbing the GOP framebuffer was easy peasy. I also added a function that would set the maximum size supported by the screen without exceding a threthhold such as 1920x1080.\nWhen passing the GOP infomation to my kernel, I had to deal with rust lifetimes, which I had never messed with before. However it was relativily strait forward to set everthing to 'static.\nFor printing to the GOP buffer I once again used Poncho’s tutorial as assistance of how to write to the memory address. However creating the println! macro proved challenging as I needed to have a static Global writer method, but I only got the GOP infomation in the kernel entry. To overcome this I made GOP an  and made the kernel set it first.\nI used core::ptr::copy to copy to video buffer from the bottom to the top over itself as a very efficient scroll mechanism. I also invented a colour! macro that simply sets the hexadecimal colour that the writer uses.\nTo test this all out I created a for loop that prints Red, Green and Blue in their repective colours, as shown in the image below.\n","wordCount":"644","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"CraftyDH"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://craftydh.github.io/CraftyOS-Blog/posts/start/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"CraftyOS Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://craftydh.github.io/CraftyOS-Blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
