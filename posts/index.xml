But seriously I spend 72 hours rewriting and rewriting my interrupt handlers to no avail. I believe that the problem was that I could not setup paging correctly and as such caused general protection faults and as I could not handle these faults I wasted so much time. Therefore in order to catch up to my schedule I have chosen to follow Philipp Oppermann&amp;rsquo;s blog_os to completion and then implement the other features on top.</description></item><item><title>The beginnings of CraftyOS</title><link>https://craftydh.github.io/CraftyOS-Blog/posts/start/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craftydh.github.io/CraftyOS-Blog/posts/start/</guid><description>Why make an OS? The purpose of this project is to learn how computers work at a basic level by programming a bare bones OS. This will help myself learn the various complexities behind the OS abstractions that are used in conventional programs.
Additionally as this project is for a school project, I had the requirement of creating a digitial application in 16 weeks. With that in mind, I wanted to choose a complex topic where I could make something cool while learning another area of computer science.</description></item></channel></rss>
