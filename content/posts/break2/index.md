As the assignment is due soon, I have started work on the project presentation instead of working on new features. Due to how complicated multitasking was my timeline was a little skewed and I will unfortunately not complete the deliverables of a filesystem or networking. However I believe that the added multitasking abilities and syscalls make up adequatly for the losses in functionality.
