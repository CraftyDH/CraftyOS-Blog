## Why make an OS?

The purpose of this project is to learn how computers work at a basic level by programming a bare bones OS. This will help myself learn the various complexities behind the OS abstractions that are used in conventional programs.

## Project timeline

This following list is my current timeline. I have estimated that each step should take approximately 2 weeks for me to complete (hopefully).

1. Creating a UEFI Application. (This post)
2. Loading the IDT and GDT.
3. Interrups and PS2 keyboard and mouse.
4. PCI bus and basic USB.
5. Memory and a basic memory allocator.
6. File System.
7. Multitasking async/await.
8. Basic terminal.
9. Basic networking stack.
10. Cool things I think of as I go...
